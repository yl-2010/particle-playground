# flash_uf2.sh -- convert a compiled .hex to .uf2 and drag-and-drop it onto
# a board's UF2 bootloader drive. This is the most foolproof upload path
# in this repo: no debug probe, no OpenOCD, no Arduino IDE, no serial
# protocol to go wrong - just a file copy onto a mass-storage volume that
# appears when the board is in its bootloader.
#
#   ./tools/flash_uf2.sh /tmp/build_blank_argon_uf2/zephyr/zephyr.hex --yes
#   ./tools/flash_uf2.sh path/to/your/own/bootloader-safe-build.hex --yes
#
# The hex must be linked above the SoftDevice/bootloader boundary
# (0x26000) - e.g. ./tools/build_blank_app.sh argon --uf2's output. A hex
# linked below that (like most of prebuilt/*.hex, which are built for
# direct SWD flashing at 0x0) is refused by default - see uf2conv.py.
#
# Requirements, both one-time and already covered elsewhere in this repo:
#   1. Adafruit's nRF52 UF2 bootloader must already be on the board -
#      ./tools/flash.sh xenon-arduino  (or argon-arduino), over SWD, once.
#   2. The board must actually be IN its bootloader right now, which shows
#      up as a mounted USB drive named e.g. XENONBOOT or ARGONBOOT. Double-
#      tap the board's physical RESET button to enter it, or - if it's
#      currently running an Adafruit-bootloader-based Arduino sketch and
#      enumerating as a serial port - this script will try the standard
#      1200-baud-touch trick automatically (opening and closing the port
#      at 1200 baud is what Arduino IDE's own Upload button does to
#      trigger the same bootloader re-entry, no button press needed).
#
# This writes application flash at the .hex file's own address range - it
# never touches the bootloader itself. uf2conv.py additionally refuses (by
# default) to convert a hex whose lowest address is below 0x26000, since
# that would fall inside the SoftDevice/bootloader's own territory once the
# Adafruit bootloader is on the board - see uf2conv.py's header comment
# and pass --allow-low-address (forwarded here to uf2conv.py) for the rare
# legitimate case that needs to bypass it.
