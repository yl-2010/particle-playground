 * xenon_sensor - dual-mode telemetry node for the Particle Xenon (nRF52840)
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Architecture, for the reviewer
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This firmware boots into one of two mutually exclusive radio modes:
 *
 *   Mode 1 (BLE):    a GATT peripheral notifying telemetry to a connected
 *                     central. This is the original xenon_sensor behavior,
 *                     unchanged.
 *   Mode 2 (Thread):  an 802.15.4/Thread node that forms/joins a Thread
 *                     network using hardcoded credentials and periodically
 *                     sends the same telemetry over UDP multicast.
 *
 * Why a reboot is required to switch: the nRF52840 has a single 2.4GHz
 * radio. BLE and 802.15.4/Thread both want it, and Zephyr's BLE controller
 * and the 802.15.4 driver both want the same RADIO_IRQn vector - they
 * cannot usefully run at the same time on this hardware. So instead of
 * attempting to hot-swap radio stacks, the selected mode is persisted to
 * flash (NVS) and read once at boot; only that mode's stack is ever
 * started. Switching modes is a deliberate, explicit action (hold the
 * MODE button at boot) followed by a reboot - not a limitation to work
 * around, but the honest shape of the hardware constraint.
 *
 * Section map:
 *   1. Wire format                 - shared 8-byte telemetry struct
 *   2. Mode selection               - persisted mode, MODE button handling
 *   3. Shared sensor sampling       - die-temp + VDD read, used by both modes
 *   4. Mode 1: BLE                  - GATT service, advertising, connections
 *   5. Mode 2: Thread                - network join, UDP multicast send
 *   6. Status LED                    - visual mode/connection/switch readout
 *   7. Sampling thread               - shared loop, dispatches by mode
 *   8. Entry point                   - mode load/switch, stack bring-up
 *
 * Concurrency/power notes carried over from the original BLE-only version
 * still apply: sensor sampling runs on its own K_THREAD_DEFINE() thread,
 * decoupled from main() and from the Bluetooth host / OpenThread work
 * queue threads, and spends nearly all its life blocked in k_sleep() so
 * Zephyr's tickless kernel can drop into deep idle between samples.
